This project automates the visualization of 2616 top rated TV shows by creating a 3D bar graph.
The benefit of a 3D graph is the advantage of being able to zoom out or manipulate the camera as desired.
This means we can compare and contrast up to more than 2500 points of data which cannot be accomplished with a regular 2D bar chart.

Libraries used:
* D3
* ThreeJS. 

(We had to cut out the D'amelio Show Due to Reasons Beyond Human Comprehension.)
